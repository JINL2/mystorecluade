# Store Location Feature Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implementation Complete

The store location feature has been successfully implemented in the Store Settings page, following the pattern from the FlutterFlow version but adapted to the Toss design system.

## What Was Added

### 1. UI Components
- **New "Store Location" option** in Operational Settings section
- Displays under "Check-in Distance" setting
- Shows current status: "Tap to set store location" or "Location set - Tap to update"
- Uses `FontAwesomeIcons.mapLocationDot` icon

### 2. Location Capture Flow
1. **Permission Handling**
   - Requests location permission when user taps the option
   - Shows error with "Settings" button if permission denied
   - Uses `permission_handler` package

2. **GPS Coordinate Capture**
   - Shows loading dialog while fetching location
   - Uses high accuracy GPS via `geolocator` package
   - Displays coordinates and accuracy in confirmation sheet

3. **Location Confirmation Dialog**
   - Shows latitude, longitude, and accuracy
   - Informative message about check-in usage
   - Cancel and Set Location buttons

### 3. Database Integration
- **Uses existing `update_store_location` RPC function** in Supabase
- Saves to existing `store_location` field (GEOGRAPHY type) in stores table
- Coordinates stored as PostGIS point: POINT(longitude, latitude)
- Updates are reflected immediately after successful save

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/presentation/pages/store_shift/store_shift_page.dart`**
   - Added imports for geolocator and permission_handler
   - Added new config option in `_buildStoreConfigSection`
   - Added 4 new methods:
     - `_getLocationSubtitle()` - Returns display text for location status
     - `_showLocationSettingSheet()` - Main location capture flow
     - `_buildLocationDetailRow()` - UI helper for location details
     - `_updateStoreLocation()` - Supabase integration

## How It Works

1. User navigates to Store Settings > Store Settings tab
2. Under "Operational Settings", taps "Store Location"
3. App requests location permission (if not granted)
4. App fetches current GPS coordinates
5. User confirms location in bottom sheet
6. Location saved to Supabase via RPC function
7. UI updates to show "Location set - Tap to update"

## Database Details

The location is saved to the existing `stores` table:
- Field: `store_location` (GEOGRAPHY type)
- Format: PostGIS POINT with SRID 4326
- Used with `allowed_distance` field for check-in validation

## Dependencies Used
All packages were already in `pubspec.yaml`:
- `geolocator: ^11.0.0`
- `permission_handler: ^11.3.1`
- `supabase_flutter`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to Store Settings page
- [ ] Select a store from the dropdown
- [ ] Go to "Store Settings" tab
- [ ] Tap "Store Location" under Operational Settings
- [ ] Grant location permission
- [ ] Confirm location in dialog
- [ ] Verify success message
- [ ] Check that subtitle changes to "Location set"
- [ ] Tap again to update location
- [ ] Test permission denial flow

## Note on RPC Function

The `update_store_location` RPC function already exists in your Supabase instance (confirmed by its usage in the FlutterFlow version). No additional SQL setup is required unless you want to deploy to a new Supabase instance.

## Next Steps (Optional)

Consider these enhancements:
1. Display actual coordinates in the subtitle when location is set
2. Add a map view to visualize the location
3. Show address from reverse geocoding
4. Add manual coordinate entry option
5. Display last updated timestamp
