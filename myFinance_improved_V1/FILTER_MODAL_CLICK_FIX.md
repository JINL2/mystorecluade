# Filter Modal Click Issue Fix

## Problem
The filter modal in the inventory management page was not responding to any clicks. Users couldn't select filter options or apply filters.

## Root Cause
The temporary state variables (`tempSelectedCategory`, `tempSelectedBrand`, `tempSelectedStockStatus`) were being declared inside the `StatefulBuilder`'s builder function. This caused them to be re-initialized on every rebuild, immediately losing any state changes when `setModalState` was called.

```dart
// WRONG - variables inside builder get reset on every rebuild
StatefulBuilder(
  builder: (context, setModalState) {
    String? tempSelectedCategory = _selectedCategory; // Re-initialized on each rebuild!
    // ... rest of the code
  }
)
```

## Solution
Created a proper stateful widget (`_FilterSheetContent`) to manage the filter modal's state:

1. **Created `_FilterSheetContent` StatefulWidget** - A dedicated widget for the filter sheet
2. **Created `_FilterSheetContentState`** - Proper state management with `initState` and persistent state variables
3. **Moved temp variables to state class** - Variables are now class members that persist across rebuilds
4. **Added callback for applying filters** - Clean separation of concerns with `onApplyFilters` callback

## Implementation Details

### New Structure
```dart
class _FilterSheetContent extends StatefulWidget {
  final InventoryMetadata? metadata;
  final String? initialCategory;
  final String? initialBrand;
  final String? initialStockStatus;
  final Function(String?, String?, String?) onApplyFilters;
  // ...
}

class _FilterSheetContentState extends State<_FilterSheetContent> {
  late String? tempSelectedCategory;  // Persistent state
  late String? tempSelectedBrand;     // Persistent state
  late String? tempSelectedStockStatus; // Persistent state
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize once with widget's initial values
    tempSelectedCategory = widget.initialCategory;
    tempSelectedBrand = widget.initialBrand;
    tempSelectedStockStatus = widget.initialStockStatus;
  }
  
  // ... build method with proper setState calls
}
```

### Key Changes
1. **State Persistence** - Filter selections now persist across rebuilds
2. **Proper setState** - Using standard `setState` instead of `setModalState` 
3. **Clean Architecture** - Separated filter UI from main page logic
4. **Helper Methods** - Moved `_buildFilterSection` and `_buildFilterChip` into the new widget

## Testing
- ✅ Filter options are now clickable
- ✅ Selections persist within the modal
- ✅ "Clear All" button works correctly
- ✅ "Apply Filters" button applies all selections at once
- ✅ Modal state is properly initialized with current filters

## Files Modified
- `/lib/presentation/pages/inventory_management/inventory_management_page_v2.dart`
  - Refactored filter sheet into separate stateful widget
  - Fixed class structure and method organization
  - Added extension for remaining methods

## Status
✅ Issue resolved - Filter modal is now fully interactive and functional
