# üéØ **DEBT ACCOUNT MAPPING SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

## **üîç What This Page Is For:**
**Page Name**: Debt Account Settings Page (`/debtAccountSettings/:counterpartyId/:counterpartyName`)

**Primary Purpose**: 
- Create and manage **debt account mappings** between internal companies
- Ensure **both sides** of inter-company debt transactions are recorded automatically
- Prevent **data integrity violations** where only one company records a debt transaction

**Business Problem Solved**:
```
‚ùå BEFORE: Company A lends $1000 to Company B
   - Company A records: Account Receivable $1000 ‚úÖ
   - Company B records: NOTHING ‚ùå
   - Result: Unbalanced books, audit failure

‚úÖ AFTER: With Account Mapping
   - Company A records: Account Receivable $1000 (manual)
   - Company B records: Account Payable $1000 (automatic via mapping)
   - Result: Both companies have balanced, consistent records
```

## **üèóÔ∏è RPC-ONLY Implementation Strategy**

## **üìä RPC Functions Design**

### **1. Get Account Mappings with Company Info**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_account_mappings_with_company(
    p_counterparty_id UUID
) RETURNS TABLE (
    mapping_id UUID,
    my_company_id UUID,
    my_account_id UUID,
    counterparty_id UUID,
    linked_account_id UUID,
    direction TEXT,
    created_by UUID,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    -- DERIVED FIELDS
    linked_company_id UUID,
    linked_company_name TEXT,
    my_account_name TEXT,
    linked_account_name TEXT
) LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT 
        am.mapping_id,
        am.my_company_id,
        am.my_account_id,
        am.counterparty_id,
        am.linked_account_id,
        am.direction,
        am.created_by,
        am.created_at,

    WHERE am.counterparty_id = p_counterparty_id
    ORDER BY am.created_at DESC;
END;
$$;
```

### **2. Find Inter-Company Journals**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION find_inter_company_journals(
    p_target_company_id UUID
) RETURNS TABLE (
    source_entry_id UUID,
    source_company_id UUID,

    WHERE cp.is_internal = true
    AND cp.linked_company_id = p_target_company_id
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        -- Check if corresponding entry already exists
        SELECT 1 FROM journal_entries existing
        WHERE existing.reference_number = je.reference_number
        AND existing.company_id = p_target_company_id
    )
    GROUP BY je.entry_id, je.company_id, je.counterparty_id;
END;
$$;
```

## **üìù Notes for Tomorrow**

1. **First Priority**: Analyze the `direction` field to understand its purpose
2. **Check Data**: Verify `counterparties.linked_company_id` is populated
3. **Test RPC**: Create and test the first RPC function
4. **Debug Mode**: Keep debug logging active to understand data flow
5. **Document Findings**: Record all discoveries about the database structure

**Start Time**: Begin with Phase 1.1 - Direction field analysis
**End Goal**: Complete foundation setup and have working RPC functions
