# Enhanced Transaction Filters Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the Transaction History page with two new powerful filter options:
1. **Created By** - Filter transactions by the user who created them
2. **Accounts** - Multi-select filter to view transactions for specific accounts

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Created By Filter
- **Purpose**: Helps managers and auditors track which team member created specific transactions
- **Implementation**: Single-select dropdown showing user names with transaction counts
- **Use Cases**:
  - Audit trail for accountability
  - Performance monitoring of data entry staff
  - Finding transactions created by specific employees

### 2. Multi-Select Account Filter
- **Purpose**: Allow users to view transactions for multiple accounts simultaneously
- **Implementation**: Multi-select dropdown with search functionality
- **Features**:
  - Search accounts by name
  - Select/deselect multiple accounts
  - Visual indicator showing number of selected accounts
  - Clear all button for quick reset
- **Use Cases**:
  - Viewing all cash-related accounts together
  - Analyzing multiple expense accounts
  - Comparing related accounts side-by-side

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. Data Models
**File**: `/lib/data/models/transaction_history_model.dart`
- Added `createdBy` field to TransactionFilter
- Added `accountIds` array field for multi-select support
- Added `users` list to TransactionFilterOptions

#### 2. SQL Functions
**File**: `/sql/enhanced_transaction_filters.sql`
- Enhanced `get_transaction_history` function with new parameters:
  - `p_created_by` - Filter by user ID
  - `p_account_ids` - Array of account IDs for multi-select
- Enhanced `get_transaction_filter_options` to return users list
- Added performance indexes for better query speed

#### 3. Provider Updates
**File**: `/lib/presentation/pages/transactions/providers/transaction_history_provider.dart`
- Updated RPC call parameters to include new filters
- Added methods: `setCreatedBy()` and `setAccountIds()`
- Updated filter options parsing to include users

#### 4. UI Components
**New File**: `/lib/presentation/widgets/toss/toss_multi_select_dropdown.dart`
- Created reusable multi-select dropdown component
- Features: Search, select all/clear, visual feedback
- Follows Toss design system guidelines

**File**: `/lib/presentation/pages/transactions/widgets/transaction_filter_sheet.dart`
- Added Created By dropdown
- Replaced single account dropdown with multi-select version
- Updated clear/apply filter logic

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy SQL Functions to Supabase
```sql
-- Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: /sql/enhanced_transaction_filters.sql
```

### Step 2: Test the Functions
```sql
-- Test get_transaction_history with new parameters
SELECT get_transaction_history(
  p_company_id := 'your-company-id',
  p_created_by := 'user-id',
  p_account_ids := ARRAY['account-id-1', 'account-id-2']::UUID[]
);

-- Test get_transaction_filter_options
SELECT get_transaction_filter_options(
  p_company_id := 'your-company-id'
);
```

### Step 3: Run Flutter App
```bash
# Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```

## User Guide

### Using the Created By Filter
1. Open Transaction History page
2. Tap the filter icon
3. In the filter sheet, find "Created By" dropdown
4. Select a user to see only their transactions
5. Tap "Apply Filter"

### Using the Multi-Select Account Filter
1. Open Transaction History page
2. Tap the filter icon
3. Find "Accounts" dropdown
4. Tap to open multi-select sheet
5. Search for accounts (optional)
6. Check multiple accounts you want to filter
7. Tap "Apply" in the sheet
8. Tap "Apply Filter" in main filter

### Combining Filters
All filters work together:
- Select date range + specific user + multiple accounts
- Example: "Show all cash transactions created by John in January"

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes Added
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_journal_entries_created_by ON journal_entries(created_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_journal_entries_company_store ON journal_entries(company_id, store_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_journal_lines_account_id ON journal_lines(account_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_journal_entries_entry_date ON journal_entries(entry_date DESC);
```

### Query Optimization
- Filters are applied at the database level for best performance
- Multi-account filter uses PostgreSQL array operations
- Results are paginated (50 records default)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Deploy SQL functions to Supabase
- [ ] Verify functions return correct data
- [ ] Test Created By filter shows all users
- [ ] Test multi-select accounts works correctly
- [ ] Test search in multi-select dropdown
- [ ] Test clear all filters functionality
- [ ] Test filter combinations work together
- [ ] Verify transaction counts in filter options
- [ ] Test performance with large datasets
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Better Accountability**: Track who created each transaction
- **Flexible Analysis**: View multiple accounts at once
- **Improved Efficiency**: Find transactions faster with smart filters
- **Better UX**: Search functionality in dropdowns for quick selection

### For Management
- **Audit Trail**: Monitor employee transaction creation

## Future Enhancements
1. Add "Recently Used" section in filters
2. Save filter presets for common searches
3. Add date range presets (Last 7 days, Last month, etc.)
4. Export filtered results to CSV/PDF
5. Add more smart filters (amount range, balance status)
