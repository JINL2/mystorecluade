# Click Data Collection

## Requirement
1. User clicks any feature anywhere
2. Store data in Supabase `user_preferences` table

## Complete Table Structure
Based on your table, all required fields:

```sql
user_preferences:
- id (uuid) - Primary Key (auto-generated)
- user_id (uuid) - Current logged-in user ID  
- feature_id (uuid) - Feature's unique ID from features table
- feature_name (varchar) - Name of clicked feature
- category_id (uuid) - Feature's category ID
- clicked_at (timestamp) - When click occurred
- created_at (timestamp) - Record creation time (auto-generated)
- updated_at (timestamp) - Record update time (auto-generated) 
```

## Data to Store
```json
{
  "user_id": "[current user id]",
  "feature_id": "[feature's unique id from features table]",
  "feature_name": "[clicked feature name]",
  "category_id": "[feature's category id]", 
  "clicked_at": "[current timestamp]"
}
```

**Note**: `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` are auto-generated by Supabase.
