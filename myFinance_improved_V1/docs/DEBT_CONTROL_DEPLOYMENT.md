# Debt Control Implementation - Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The debt control feature is now fully implemented with single data fetch and local filtering as requested.

## üìã What Was Implemented

### 1. **Supabase RPC Function** ‚úÖ
- Created comprehensive RPC function `get_debt_control_data` that fetches all debt data in one call
- Returns metadata, summary, store aggregates, and all records
- Supports both company and store perspectives
- Calculates internal/external totals automatically

### 2. **Repository Updates** ‚úÖ
- Updated `SupabaseDebtRepository` to use the RPC function
- Implemented 5-minute caching to reduce database calls
- Added local filtering for internal/external/all categories
- All filtering happens locally in Flutter for instant UI updates

### 3. **Local State Management** ‚úÖ
- Single data fetch on page load
- Local filtering without additional API calls
- Cache management with force refresh option
- Instant filter switching (no loading states)

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Execute SQL in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and execute the SQL from: `/supabase/functions/get_debt_control_data.sql`
4. Verify the function was created:
   ```sql
   SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'get_debt_control_data';
   ```

### Step 2: Test the RPC Function

Execute this test query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Test with your actual company ID
SELECT get_debt_control_data(
    '7a2545e0-e112-4b0c-9c59-221a530c4602'::UUID,  -- Replace with your company_id
    NULL  -- or provide store_id for store perspective
);
```

Expected response structure:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "company_id": "...",
    "store_id": null,
    "perspective": "company",
    "generated_at": "2024-01-15T...",
    "currency": "‚Ç´"
  },
  "summary": {
    "total_receivable": 25000000,
    "total_payable": 9500000,
    "net_position": 15500000,
    "internal_receivable": 7500000,
    "internal_payable": 3000000,
    "external_receivable": 17500000,
    "external_payable": 6500000,
    "counterparty_count": 25,
    "transaction_count": 156
  },
  "store_aggregates": [
    {
      "store_id": "...",
      "store_name": "Main Store",
      "receivable": 12000000,
      "payable": 4500000,
      "net_position": 7500000,
      "counterparty_count": 15
    }
  ],
  "records": [
    {
      "counterparty_id": "...",
      "counterparty_name": "ABC Corporation",
      "is_internal": false,
      "receivable_amount": 1000000,
      "payable_amount": 500000,
      "net_amount": 500000,
      "transaction_count": 12,
      "days_outstanding": 45
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Flutter App Testing

The Flutter code is already updated and ready. Test these features:

1. **Initial Load**: Page loads all data in one RPC call
2. **Filter Switching**: Instant filtering between All/My Group/External (no loading)
3. **Tab Switching**: Company/Store views work with cached data
4. **Pull to Refresh**: Forces cache clear and fresh data fetch
5. **5-minute Cache**: Data auto-refreshes after 5 minutes

## üîß Configuration

### Cache Settings
- **Duration**: 5 minutes (configurable in repository)
- **Clear Cache**: Pull-to-refresh or filter changes
- **Auto-refresh**: After cache expiry

### Performance Optimizations
- Single RPC call for all data
- Local filtering (no server roundtrips)
- Cached data for instant UI updates
- Optimized SQL with proper indexes

## üìä Database Requirements

Ensure these tables exist with proper structure:
- `debts` - Main debt records
- `counterparties` - Counterparty information
- `stores` - Store details
- `companies` - Company information

Required indexes (created by SQL script):
- `idx_debts_company_store_deleted`
- `idx_debts_counterparty_deleted`

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] RPC function executes without errors
- [ ] Company perspective shows all stores
- [ ] Store perspective filters to single store
- [ ] Internal filter shows only internal counterparties
- [ ] External filter shows only external counterparties
- [ ] All filter shows everything
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh clears cache
- [ ] UI updates instantly on filter change
- [ ] Store aggregates display in company view
- [ ] Net positions calculate correctly

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: RPC function not found
**Solution**: Ensure SQL was executed in correct database/schema

### Issue: No data returned
**Solution**: Check if debts table has data for your company_id

### Issue: Slow performance
**Solution**: Ensure indexes were created, check query performance in Supabase

### Issue: Cache not clearing
**Solution**: Pull-to-refresh or wait 5 minutes for auto-refresh

## üìà Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**
   - Execute SQL in production database
   - Test with production data
   - Monitor performance

2. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add date range filtering (locally)
   - Implement aging analysis
   - Add export functionality
   - Create debt detail views

## ‚ú® Key Benefits

1. **Performance**: Single RPC call vs multiple queries
2. **User Experience**: Instant filter switching
3. **Efficiency**: 5-minute cache reduces server load
4. **Scalability**: Local filtering handles large datasets
5. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of data fetch and filtering
