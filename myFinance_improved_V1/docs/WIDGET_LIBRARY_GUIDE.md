   - Check if some do the same job → Combine or remove duplicates

5. **"Do we need 2 different loading screens?"**
   - Pick the one you like better → Delete the other

### 💡 **How to Tell Your Team**

**"Hey team! Let's Marie Kondo our widget toolbox! 🧹**

**I found some widgets that might be doing the same job:**

- We should pick the best one and donate the rest

**Questions to discuss:**
1. Do we need BOTH list AND grid views for features?
2. Are we using ALL our button types?
