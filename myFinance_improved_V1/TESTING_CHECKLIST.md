# Testing Checklist for Company & Store Operations

## 🔬 Ultra-Deep Verification Complete

### ✅ Fixed Issues

#### Navigation Safety
- **Fixed**: Removed premature `Navigator.pop()` calls in `_handleCreateCompany` and `_handleCreateStore`
- **Fixed**: Modal stays open during operation, closes only on success
- **Fixed**: Proper sequential closing of modal then drawer on success
- **Fixed**: All navigator operations now check `canPop()` before popping

#### Context Safety
- **Fixed**: ScaffoldMessenger captured early before async operations
- **Fixed**: Navigator captured and reused, not accessed after async
- **Fixed**: All operations check `mounted` state where applicable

#### User Experience Flow
- **Fixed**: Consistent loading feedback with spinners in SnackBar
- **Fixed**: Success messages show entity names
- **Fixed**: Auto-selection of newly created/joined entities
- **Fixed**: Force refresh of all related providers
