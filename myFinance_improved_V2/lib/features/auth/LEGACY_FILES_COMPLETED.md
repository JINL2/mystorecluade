# ✅ Legacy Files Migration - COMPLETED (2025-10-16)

This document tracked the legacy files that needed migration.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All legacy files have been successfully migrated to Clean Architecture pattern.

### What Was Migrated:
- Auth/User modules from Legacy (DTO+Mapper) to Clean Architecture (DataSource+Model)
- 15 legacy files removed
- 5 new Clean Architecture files created

### Before → After:
- DTOs (9 files) → Models (integrated into existing 5 model files)
- Mappers (3 files) → Model.toEntity() methods
- Legacy Repositories (2 files) → Clean Architecture RepositoryImpl (2 files)
- data_exceptions.dart → Removed (DataSource handles exceptions)

See README.md for full details of the migration.

## Architecture Now:
✅ 100% Clean Architecture
